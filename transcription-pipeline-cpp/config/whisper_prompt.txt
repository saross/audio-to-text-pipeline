# Whisper Transcription Guidance Prompt
# For use with interviews about RVA

The recording is a technical interview about research vocabulary management and research vocabulary technologies. It considers the future of the 'Research Vocabularies Australia' product offered by the Australian Research Data Commons. The conversation includes detailed technical discussion about semantic technologies, software platforms, and governance considerations.


TRANSCRIPTION PRIORITIES
1. Accurately capture technical terms (especially SKOS, SISSVoc, RVA)
2. Preserve original terminology used by speakers
3. Use Australian English spelling and punctuation


CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT
- This is an interview with questions and answers
- Speech segments often alternate between interviewer and interviewee
- The recording contains natural turn-taking, including occasional interruptions
- Focus on accurate transcription of content rather than identifying who is speaking
- Be attentive to changes in topic that might signal a new question or speaking turn

TECHNICAL REFERENCES
Some terms may be used interchangeably by speakers (e.g., 'RVA' and 'Research Vocabularies Australia') - preserve the actual terminology used by the speaker rather than standardising. Speakers may reference technical interfaces, demonstrations, or workflows. When describing technical elements, maintain exact terminology even if it seems unusual or non-standard. Pay special attention to distinguishing between different software products (like 'Prez' vs 'VocPrez') and standards (like 'SKOS' vs 'SSSOM'). Expect frequent references to 'Research Vocabularies Australia' and 'RVA'. URLs, API endpoints, and code snippets should be transcribed exactly as spoken.


SPEECH PATTERNS
- Handle false starts and hesitations naturally (e.g., 'Um, I think... I mean...')
- Maintain sentence flow even with pauses or filler words
- Include restarts and self-corrections as they occur


UNCLEAR SPEECH
When speech is unclear or unintelligible, please use [inaudible] rather than attempting to guess what was said. If only part of a phrase is unclear, transcribe the clear portions and use [inaudible] only for the unclear segments. Prioritise accuracy over completeness.


NON-SPEECH SOUNDS
There are instances of laughter, background noises, and interruptions in this recording. Non-speech sounds should be transcribed within square brackets, such as [laughter], [background noise], or [door closing]. For extended silences or pauses, use [silence]. For brief pauses in speech, use appropriate punctuation (commas, ellipses) rather than bracketed notations.


AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH NOTE
Use, for example, 'organisation' not 'organization', 'specialised' not 'specialized', 'colour' not 'color'. Also be aware of Australian colloquialisms and speech patterns. Fall back to British English rather than American English if you are unsure.
