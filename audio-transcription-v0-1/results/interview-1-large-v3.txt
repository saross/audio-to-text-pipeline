# Transcript of interview-1.flac

[00:00:00] SPEAKER_01: Waiting for something to change in there. Yes, it's recording. I can see that now. Yep. It says it's been recording for 10 minutes or something.

[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I've been sitting here. I've had the screen open for 10 minutes.

[00:00:16] SPEAKER_01: I only just pressed recording. I've got to shut this transcript box because I can see the text going through. Yep.

[00:00:27] SPEAKER_01: Okay. And I'll also try not to speak over you because that won't help with the transcript.

[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: Right. So the first one, what critical gap does the RVA fill in for Australian research in the future?

[00:00:46] SPEAKER_01: Is there a critical gap?

[00:00:48] SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. RVA fills a really important gap, satisfies a really important need, which is the ability to have.

[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: Standardized shared classification systems and vocabularies online in a reliable way, which is trusted, or at least the system is trustworthy, whether the classifications are trustworthy is a separate issue, but the availability of the system managed and hosted by a reliable organization is really important. The particular niche, I think that RVA fills, which is a bit different to, for example, the National Library,

[00:01:34] SPEAKER_01: is that it provides a platform for anyone in the Australian research ecosystem to register controlled vocabularies and make them available so that they can be used by anyone,

[00:01:52] SPEAKER_01: not just in the Australian research ecosystem,

[00:01:56] SPEAKER_01: so that it can be, and that allows the correlation of research activities and research results between different initiatives, different experiments,

[00:02:09] SPEAKER_01: but using standardized vocabularies, it's absolutely critical.

[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: So I'd ask the question, I've heard people say this, well, why would you not put them in another vocabulary server? Is this content wise somewhere where you'd put things, where you, you know, there's not a specific, very specific server off somewhere overseas? The other servers that are available tend to be either institution or discipline limited.

[00:02:44] SPEAKER_01: So to my knowledge, Research Recovery Australia is actually unusual globally, in the sense that it provides a standard, reliable platform, for anyone from any discipline and any institution in the Australian research ecosystem.

[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: Sorry, I just don't, I've got a lot, I've got a lost child in the hole.

[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: Gwen!

[00:03:19] SPEAKER_00: I said,

[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: can you keep them quiet? And she's,

[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: you might want to mute while you're dealing with that.

[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: Sorry about that.

[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: She should find them. I said, can you just keep them quiet for an hour? Yeah, that's interesting.

[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: It does seem to be one of the more generalist repositories. I was trying to think globally, is there another? Is there another? I'm not aware of another one, but then again, I'm less connected than I was a couple of years ago when I retired from CSIRO. So I haven't been paying as much immediate attention to it. So, you know, and that, that caveat needs to be applied to a lot of my comments during this interview. And we have to be fair about that. I'm, I'm, I may be a little stale in some areas. Okay. Yep. All right.

[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: So the second one, second question.

[00:04:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So scope and content. Yeah. Scope and content. How does RVA support the, the predominant smart semantic artifact types that are generally coded in the domain? Actually, I should have asked you the introduction questions. I jumped straight in going, are you, what is your other domain that you feel that you can comment on in terms of content? I guess,

[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: are you talking earth environment or primarily earth and environmentally? Yes. Yeah. I mean, my, I have, I have a, a, an interest and a curiosity about more generalized domains.

[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: So in the conversations this morning in the RDA, which is going on at the moment, you know, there was, there was a lot of earth and environment people there, but one of the guys there was talking about batteries.

[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: And so, and, and that, and that was, that was a,

[00:05:24] UNKNOWN:  

[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: that I, I certainly have an ambition to be thinking about these things. Quite generally, non domain specific informed primarily by the domains, which I've worked most closely with, which have been earth and environment, but but, but always willing and infected keen to think about doing things more generalized.

[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So say in the earth and environment domain, does RVA cater for the predominant types that you're seeing people requesting semantic artefacts services for? Are they general simple vocabularies or is there a different type that you're hearing people want to be able to store? I'm not hearing anything else. The fact that RVA is focused on simple vocabularies, Scots vocabularies, which are not that simple.

[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: But it's kind of a, it's a little bit above lowest common denominator, but it's sort of the, it's almost like a minimum viable product thing. If you're trying to do semantic classification.

[00:06:47] SPEAKER_01: And vocabularies.

[00:06:50] SPEAKER_01: Because it's based on an RDF store, it does mean that you don't have to be limited to Scots. You can add additional RDF properties in with your entries. And I have taken advantage of that in some of the vocabularies which I've published. The corollary though, or the downside of that is that in order to appear. In a logical way within RVA.

[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: It has to have Scots. It will only list Scots concepts. So if you're publishing something which isn't in advance encoded as Scots concepts, then you have to add that layer to it. So that came up and this really overlaps to the next question as well. Or a bit of this one and the next one. The particular set of artifacts that I've been involved in most recently with my consulting work with CSIRO were mappings and crosswalks. So the, those we encoded in a inspired by SSSOM form. So those are each item in the. List of.

[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: In the list of items within the quote vocabulary on quote. Each item there is a mapping which maps between two concept schemes. Individual concepts between those two concept schemes. And in order to get those to appear in RVA in a logical way. We had to add an additional type. If you like to each mapping and say. That's what we're looking for.  The mapping is a concept. A Scots concept.

[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: I'm reflecting to and fro about that myself. It's not. It's not an unreasonable constraint. Given the the design goals of RVA.

[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: It, you know, initially it kind of came across as a little bit unnatural. But then when I thought it through a little bit, I thought, no, that's not an unreasonable constraint. This is a vocabulary service. You need to have some kind of. Base types that you say that you are managing and those and and it's reasonable for those to be Scots concepts. So but it but it it does require you to either. Add additional types or produce what you might call a Scots view of a vocabulary. And that that also leads into the other things that one might be interested in registering in a. Definitions service. And note, I changed my term there from vocabulary service to definition service. If you have a definition service, then you might want to to register.

[00:09:59] SPEAKER_01: Thing that. Oh, that's my wife.

[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: Let me let me.

[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: That's OK.

[00:10:20] UNKNOWN: It will follow differentfast.   On what is it.

[00:10:28] UNKNOWN: All sorts of stuff around the cat.   

[00:10:36] UNKNOWN: fool would be the only person. 

[00:10:39] UNKNOWN: In a normal state like in a normal American child. House a legal aqui Bryan Brown. you

[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: I'm back.

[00:11:22] SPEAKER_00: I'm back. Sorry about that.

[00:11:25] SPEAKER_01: Now you're muted.

[00:11:29] SPEAKER_01: Oh, whoops. There we go. Thank you. All right. Yeah, no problem. Yes. So I think you were talking about definitely. Yeah, I was talking about alternatives. And this is in your question C. C, second dot point there, broader range of accessible content. I mean, you know, personally, I've been, you know, it would be good to have richer types, whether that's a general requirement, however, and given that, you know, I would question that. I think we have to be realistic about this. You can't do everything forever. You can't do it forever.  And ontology is a bit of a refined thing, which is not as fashionable as it was 10 years ago. And, you know, with some fairly, you know, fairly significant barriers to come into terms of those. And so they're not for everyone. And it may be just that those of us who are working in these more sophisticated, more elaborate systems, we've got to accept the fact that maybe we've got to support more of that ourselves and that a general purpose system like RVA may not be up to it. The one piece of the puzzle that I would say where it would be great to see RVA increasing its scope would be mappings.

[00:13:04] SPEAKER_01: I think, you know, and in a sense, I think that flows from RVA's policies and the way that we're doing it. Very very good.

[00:13:16] SPEAKER_01: If that solution for example isizada to get STDA標 sunset, or STDA 00守 burned off as a better posibleness measure for but I think if it goes down to some priceップ great strikes on what happens in millennium,  busiest purchase in Turkey right now. Right now the market of Chamber Maccas has schwier to B ces,

[00:13:43] SPEAKER_01:  We need to make sure that our market is stable.  things so to to support that i i guess i feel fairly strongly that that that is as a um is really the next logical step up and it's not a huge step up particularly if you uh for example take a lead from the the work done by the people behind triple som so you know there there is a standard approach to encoding mappings so um you have multiple vocabularies in some cases covering the same scope so so let's just um close the circle here and and how about um i find it useful in other vocabulary service to see um i guess it applies more to ontologies where a concept is reused yes i find that quite like oh okay if this ontology uses this one this one this one this then i'm more likely to pick yeah yeah yeah i don't know it's like a rough test is it trustworthy i don't know but that is reused 20 times so yeah it means it's trusted by 20 people um and that's uh and that's quite a that's quite a reasonable way of evaluating trust um there there is a another question about the link open vocabularies which i'm not sure if it's i mean it's still up and running i don't know how actively it's growing or is being curated that's the one called linked open vocabularies um which is a thing run by some people in spain um going back a few years they invited me to be on their um advisory board excuse me um

[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: um i um i declined just because you can't accept every invitation that you're and um they're pretty hardcore ontologists those guys and i can i can play in that space but um my thinking was it wasn't clear that that really was where the rest of the community is is actually happy working so i decided to um

[00:16:10] UNKNOWN: 

[00:16:10] SPEAKER_01: what energies i had elsewhere yeah yeah but the reason i bring that up is they they they did have a bit of a you know this one's reused here and this one's reused their thing the other the other space where that um where you can see a bit of that would be in um uh the fair what's it called um fair sharing um where they um a but you know the problem with that how popular is this who's using it thing is that you know it needs to be automated and that's what that's not easy to do i know the um ontology lookup service does it well yeah okay that's where i see it used really well but yeah yeah i don't know if that's yeah i don't quite know how oh unless how that works but i find it useful but anyways but that's not manual that's automated that's not people doing the manual mapping right that's two separate two different issues i think so yeah okay so say ontologies a handful of people that might use them yeah encoding them as scoss or a scoss view like when they're fairly rich is probably not something the average person can you do it yes you can do it or do you miss parts parts of it that you just can't well i'll it's just a matter of time until you get to the point where you can't do it so i'm just going to say that's the point i'm just going to say that's the point i'm just going to say that's the point it's it's

[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: you can you you can always produce a scoss view um and it will be incomplete because it's not an ontology okay so it'll it'll be lossy um and the other thing which depending on where you sit in the ontology purist spectrum some people will say ah well that that breaks dl or or something like that and i think that's a good thing to do because it's a good thing to do because you know you're there you can't think like some profile of owl and this and they get their knickers in or not about uh about the the you know whether it'll mean that you can no longer do proper inferencing and reasoning and all that sort of thing and i think well yeah of course you can't because it's not want you to know because you're producing this view but do not because you'd producing this view but but but and why would you produce a scoss view you would produce a scoss view but but and why would you produce scoss view you would produce a scoss view so that people who really really are only interested in a Scoss view, you know, are handed some URIs that they can use for some concepts, which are also related or linked in to something that's richer somewhere. And it basically just saves you from having to, you know, to make a copy.

[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: So of concepts which have already been defined and already been assigned URIs. And in one space you'll be told that there are classes and in another place you'll be told, well, for this URI, we can also think of it as a Scoss concept.

[00:19:21] SPEAKER_01: Okay. So I think that's a perfectly reasonable sort of alternative way of, if you like, advertising the semantic content. So people that do have. Ontologies. What do they do with them? Say turn the answers ontology.

[00:19:46] SPEAKER_01: What happens with that? That's that's yeah. We, we ought to just have a, this would be the kind of thing, which, which Nick would, would possibly have thought of. Probably as thought of is you just have a filter that you can run your ontology through, which would automatically generate a concept for every class.

[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: And I, and would take all of the properties and make them all sub properties of Scoss semantic relation or something, you know? So, so that, you know, it would be best, frankly, if that were automated. Now I'm, I'm maybe I'm making some assumptions, which would need to be automated.    Just that good.

[00:20:50] SPEAKER_01: I meant thing. So, but we need to, we're, the, I'mensed also, you know, find some of these partnerships and ways of doing it for others. So automatically which, is, I, we should probably send in mina as our one pretty good example on those things, but that's, that's an, it's a, it would be        At Smith Log dataision. rentals. Sp guideline. Well, I mean, and I, and I took three questions and I took four of the questions and that put them together.

[00:21:08] SPEAKER_01: that's fairly you know can be yeah although the automation there would be harder because the the representation of them is inconsistent you know some of your taxonomies are are only available from a pdf you know and some of them will be in some kind of spreadsheet but you know who knows how it's organized in the spreadsheet so so you know the the the the reason why i think saying that generating a scoss view of an owl ontology is at least plausible is that you've got it in a in a regular form to start with and a predictable form which is classes and object properties um so um uh yeah so so so so so going that way where you are essentially flattening it is is easier than going the other way where you're trying to promote something from an unsemantic representation into a semantic representation and then we're getting into tooling questions which aren't so much covered in here but there's questions around uh the survey we've got some we had a question about tooling to see what people were you using and how they found it how they find pool party if they use pool party but maybe we should go on to what aspects of rva uh are working working well yeah and you would not change yeah well i i don't use pool party so i the few times i've used it i found myself fighting with it rather than rather than uh leveraging it and that's that was you know to some extent that was my fault because i was not using pool party and i was not using pool party and i was not using I was coming into it with some preconceptions about what semantics and what semantic technologies should look like. And if pool party didn't match, then that was as much my fault as pool party's fault. But I wasn't prepared to abandon my existing platform's knowledge. So I just accepted the fact that I would work outside of that. And I mean, it's interesting with that even because you know that I've been using the TopRaid platform for years and years and years. I no longer use TopRaid for any editing work. I only use TopRaid for essentially a kind of validation step. So I do all my editing in text and then I try and load it in TopRaid. And if TopRaid spits something out, then that just helps me debug. Okay. And what I've been doing in text.

[00:23:56] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, that's a very arcane set of skills that I'm utilizing there. And it's not reasonable to expect everyone to be able to do that. So when I've been attempting to teach new people coming onto this, then it's amazing how many bits and pieces you discover that, oh, yeah, I know this. But I've now got to explain it. You know, why? Why URIs are in angle brackets when you're writing them out in turtle or they're this compact form with a colon in the middle. And they both mean the same thing. They're both URIs. But a normal person looking at those says, no, they're not the same thing because they haven't got the lenses on that I've got, which sees them that way. So and, you know, I know people. Anybody in the last 10 years is coming along to look at these things wants to look at them in JSON. And JSON gives me the shits. But it's it's but but but, you know, that's not a fight I'm going to win. Not a fight I really want to win. You know, the JSON ecosystem is very, very rich and people really should be using JSON. It's just just just it doesn't hit him. So and then there's YAML coming along as well or come along.

[00:25:20] UNKNOWN: Yeah.              

[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: So I'd be f in YAML is not something I've actually got my head around either. I'd like to.

[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: But but but I'm I'm way more efficient just working in turtle and then and then using tools to to to convert it into other forms. And that's and that's fine.

[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: So and that's another thing I use top rate for. I mean, I haven't renewed my top rate license in years because the one I've got is works fine and I'm only using it in a relatively limited way. So. So you've worked with some people like I know with me, we've used the Scoss, Scoss play. Oh, yeah. A couple of different Excel. Yeah. I haven't used that recently. The last time I was doing some conversions, I was just using Python.

[00:26:08] SPEAKER_01: But and that was with some assist, you know, and it wasn't really me writing it. And I got stuck. Was that Excel to Python? Excel. Excel. Using Python to get to RDF. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's loading things into data frames in in in Python. And who knows what a little bit too old to learn too many new tricks. But and it's and it's not really it's not my day job anymore, is it? No, no, it's not. It's hard. So it's so I have no opinion on pool party. Yeah. OK.

[00:26:46] SPEAKER_01: RVA. You know, I. I really do think that the the technical platform that RVA sitting on, which is the

[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: system thing, which underneath that you've got kind of open RDF for whatever it's called.

[00:27:07] SPEAKER_01: And there's some limitations that that platform introduces on the one hand. I know that each vocabulary is in its own individual. And I think that's an interesting thing.     I think it's a good example of the instance of the of the RDF store. And that's that's that's the way it works. It used to be called Sesame. It's called open RDF or something these days.

[00:27:29] SPEAKER_01: But that that choice is good. The thing that it supports is a very strong versioning scheme and the ability to roll back and see all the versions of a vocabulary very, very discreetly. discreetly. However, it's bad because it means that links between vocabularies that are all sitting within RVA essentially don't exist. So, and it's, you know, the whole SysVoc thing is, is, you know, 15 years old now. And, and there's, there's, it's, it's, it's visual presentation is very creaky. And the, the API, which is actually what SysVoc is, it hasn't been taken up by anybody else. We'd be better looking at a more widely used platform. Now, what that is, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Could be Scosmos, could be Prez. But I don't think RVA should be running a bespoke stack, which is what it is at the moment. I think it should be adopting a stack which is used by other people as well. It should be joining a bigger software ecosystem with this. Open source is, is, you know, always, I mean, more or less everything anybody does these days is open source anyway. But if you're the only ones using and maintaining this software stack, then you're not getting, you're not leveraging anybody else's contributions. And you're essentially static. So that, that, that needs to change.

[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: Top three changes. Mappings.

[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: New platform.

[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: Something around governance. Governance is a bit creaky at the moment. You know, the open system, the, you know, the, the fact that anyone can submit and publish one is good, but it can lead to a bit of a mess.

[00:30:07] UNKNOWN: July.

[00:30:21] SPEAKER_01: Satisfaction rate. It's, it's not a conversations program and platforms have as well as things you can actually use in this industry to maintain sustainability, and to ameneca or, you know, neutralize kind of, let's just say that power level.  know, work easily to the evaluation process, like the副 Hey, you know, people should be encouraged to use the demo server to get things up, to have a poke around and have a look at them. But then the transition from the demo to the production server probably should be a governance step as well as a technical step.

[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, a review, basically. I think that's where I would go with that. Yeah. Now, there was an additional question, you know, Ro and I were chatting yesterday and said, well, do we need to think about a minimum metadata model,

[00:31:22] SPEAKER_01: you know, profile for vocabularies? Yeah.

[00:31:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Do we have that? What's that look like in RVA?

[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: It's the registry, isn't it, when you load vocabularies?

[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: Sorry. Oh, you're all right.

[00:31:50] SPEAKER_01: I muted. I've dealt with it.

[00:31:53] SPEAKER_00: Ah.

[00:31:54] SPEAKER_01: But I did miss what you were saying about what you and Ro and I have been discussing. Yeah.

[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: The requirement potentially for when you say governance, there's some checking whether there's a minimum metadata profile

[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: for vocabularies that we either – do we have it? Do we need it? I mean, there is one implied. When you publish something in RVA, there are some – you know, there is metadata about these things which is going in. You can't submit something without filling out, you know, some of those forms when you're submitting. Now, the adequacy of those, you know, getting people to fill out metadata when they're submitting stuff is always a challenge.

[00:32:51] SPEAKER_01: But it's not unreasonable for a service like this where you really are offering a very, very valuable service to say, well, in order to utilize this really valuable service, then you have to, you know, there's a couple of hoops you have to jump through. I think the guidance about those could be better.

[00:33:15] SPEAKER_01: The forms probably just need more examples. You know, I wonder if there could be examples included in the forms, you know, at least for a mouseover, you know, and maybe just text in the form saying, you know, because some of the prompts from the names of the fields where you're typing stuff in, it's not obvious why it matters, you know. So, for example, where you have to put in something about the version, well, this is going to appear in the URI of the service. So don't make it a long sentence, right? Yeah, yeah. If I hadn't have had you there talking that through with me, I wouldn't have known what to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. You know, this has implications for how this is going to look once it's published on the current system.

[00:34:08] SPEAKER_01: Now, you know, that's some technical choices that Rowan and what's-his-face sort of came to when they were putting it together. Yeah, exactly, when they were putting it together.

[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: And there were other choices that might have been made, but they were after generating unique URI. And so they were using information submitted by the submitter in order to build those. And that's a reasonable strategy, except that the submitters didn't necessarily know that that's what was going on. Yeah, yeah. Actually, it's a bit of a side question. Do you have any comments on the PIDs in the workflow of RVA? Any recommendations of PID systems? Well, I would hold off on those because of, because of the, you know, I mean, some of that stuff is a consequence of SysVoc. And if I'm already saying move to something different from SysVoc, then any detailed recommendations I'd have at this stage would be moot or they'd need to be reconsidered in the light of whatever other platform was being used. So I'm reluctant to go into details there. So. At the moment, is it handles? Is that what you call them? No, no, it's not the handles. It's the, it's the, when you, when you get a. Slug. Yeah, exactly.

[00:35:40] SPEAKER_01: The what? Sorry, I interrupted. The slug. The slug. That's good. Absolutely.

[00:35:46] SPEAKER_01: Okay.

[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: All right.

[00:35:53] SPEAKER_01: All right.

[00:35:55] SPEAKER_01: So what would be the implications if we did not,

[00:36:00] SPEAKER_01: if we did not upgrade, as you say, not be able to handle mappings or upgrade? I think RVA is, will increasingly not, you know, what we're already seeing is, you know, anyone who contracts Curawong gets a bespoke press installation put up.

[00:36:32] SPEAKER_01: And that's fine for organizations that have got a budget to go and contract Kerouac. But it means that more and more vocabularies are going to be off on their own services. And RVA will end up just being the bottom of the barrel of the ones who don't have anywhere better to go. And, you know, possibly will lose some respect and, you know, the sort of credibility and trust because of that.

[00:37:10] SPEAKER_01: So I think it needs to keep up in order to retain the trust that it has had.

[00:37:18] SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.

[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.

[00:37:25] SPEAKER_01: So explain. Opportunities.

[00:37:28] SPEAKER_01: Exploring opportunities.

[00:37:31] SPEAKER_01: I guess you did mention the linked data, the linked open vocabulary.

[00:37:37] SPEAKER_00: Linked open vocabulary. Yeah.

[00:37:39] SPEAKER_01: But are there anything kind of services overseas or, you know, anywhere that you've thought, oh, well, that's great? No. That RVA could look at adopting part of it, you know, adopting that stack or? Oh, well. I mean, OLS is pretty good.

[00:38:02] SPEAKER_01: But OLS, you know, comes out of the medical and life sciences communities and they have a lot of money, don't they?

[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So do they store vocabularies as well?

[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: You can register vocabularies there and upload them there. Yes. Well, can you do it in OLS? I'm not sure.

[00:38:25] SPEAKER_01: Maybe that would be by appointment.             I just don't know.  Yeah.

[00:38:29] SPEAKER_01: That sounds like a good thing. Yeah. Yeah.               And I mean, you know, the other, the other system, of course, which is running is the one from, Mike wants his name up in Brisbane, Glenn's cousin, came along to the first two vocabulary workshops coming from the medical domain.

[00:38:55] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.

[00:38:56] UNKNOWN: Yeah.   

[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: uh i can't remember anyway onto server yeah yes onto server exactly but that's full on you know that thing is the medical the biomedical community has got a very different approach to the use of semantic technologies to most of the rest of the communities it's all very cross-linked and interlinked and they bought into it full time full full time and and and that there's no other community that's even close to um to understanding what they're doing let alone leveraging it um so so and and they're not even there's ways in which they're you know i don't particularly like what they do but but in terms of the the coherence the community they're you know kind of exemplary but in a way which is really hard to reproduce um you know for one thing they have all kinds of regulatory um sort of things which which end up requiring people to use the system which then ends up in introducing a whole quality assurance system which um very few disciplines would have access to because they don't have the regulatory um uh imperative

[00:40:24] SPEAKER_01: so yeah in some cases you're going to be put on a operating table you want to know exactly that the data is exactly good we don't have perhaps that we don't have a driver in earth and environment

[00:40:38] SPEAKER_01: it'd be nice if the environment was taken as seriously as that but it isn't hmm do you have you had any experience or heard anything about the onto alliance

[00:40:48] SPEAKER_01: no um ever heard of instances oh they're so they're

[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: they've got the spin-offs of implementations at bioportal agri-portal whatever portal and yeah okay yeah i don't know much about them just came across yeah they're onto alliance and they're spinning out uh instances of this um stack or whatever it is so yeah i need to close the door so we're not getting quite as much background

[00:41:20] SPEAKER_01: so

[00:41:23] SPEAKER_01: yeah um no i don't i haven't been following that megan

[00:41:30] SPEAKER_01: so that's um uh clemont okay leading that yeah okay so

[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: it's fairly full-on probably i imagine like ontology stuff yeah it would be hmm all right yeah yep okay so even if it service doesn't take you know if it ontologies is out of scope yes to do the mappings yes

[00:42:02] SPEAKER_01: i i see this as what just you know what i'm really trying to identify there

[00:42:09] SPEAKER_01: um you know an incremental improvement yep right and it's and it's one that you know i i made the case it logically follows from some of the work that's been done on the map that rva is already doing um um so which is which is hosting not duplicates but but but vocabulary is with overlapping scope and therefore the the need to have something which manages that those overlaps which is mappings

[00:42:44] SPEAKER_01: okay yep yeah so i think we're getting towards the bottom yeah whether there's anything else in particular yeah you want to comment on or you think we haven't covered i i mean i look i could bang on for years in a sense but but i'm but i'm also aware that the exercise that you're doing here you need to have discrete um recommendations and and and steps forward that you can take and so i'm i'm trying to be sensible about that um and you know and for me i think it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's furthermore let's let's let's be clear um you know let's let's not overreach but let's let's but let's also not not undershoot so um so yeah yep can i ask a favor can i get you to just to repeat what with the system the the vocabulary the loading and how it's a discrete it's so can you can you explain that again each vocabulary is in its is in a a discrete triple store which is is essentially running in its own machine its own instance or something separate from every other vocabulary in rba okay so it's separate a separate triple store separate container yes so does that make it hard to the registry the registry metadata say separate to yeah is not loaded as part of that vocabulary in the triple store so it's hard to search across no no it's not that's in a separate layer yep so that makes it perhaps hard to be able to search across and link and map exactly you know on the other hand you know there was there was that link data registry thing which you may vaguely remember which we were trying to use for a while and that was a case where where the company who was responsible for what were they called epimorphics tried to do the whole thing inside one triple store and it ended up being quite complex

[00:45:08] SPEAKER_01: um and i i'm not sure where the link data registry is these days i'm not whether it's whether it's still a maintained product or whatever and it was being used a bit by the uk metal and the office and a bit by the french geological survey and i'm not sure whether whether they're still using or supporting it and they they had all of the metadata and all of the versioning and all of the content all in a single triple store and it was kind of the the paradigmatic you know this ought to be able to do everything so we will do everything now i think i i suspect they overshot because it ended up having a lot of data and a lot of data that was not available to us so i think

[00:45:56] SPEAKER_01: we might have to work on a bit of a little bit of a stable foundation for the us because even though setup for the i think

[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: there are absolutely

[00:46:20] SPEAKER_01: i think some there way to do it, but their implementation was pretty mind-bending.

[00:46:29] SPEAKER_01: So the dogs just let out now.

[00:46:34] SPEAKER_01: So you need, yeah, so the comment earlier you said about support, I guess, is there something out there that's, you know, broadly adopted enough and open and there's a community that IRDC staff can... Exactly, I'd be looking at SCOSMOS or PRESS.

[00:46:52] SPEAKER_01: Mm. And SCOSMOS, I think, is part of a little ecosystem together with VOCbench, and the VOCbench thing would be your pool party replacement and the SCOSMOS would be the SysVoc replacement part of the puzzle. Okay? I think that's how it works.

[00:47:11] SPEAKER_00: Mm.

[00:47:12] SPEAKER_01: Okay.

[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: But, you know, and VOCbench, I think, is an Italian product and I think SCOSMOS is a Finnish.

[00:47:22] SPEAKER_01: I think the maintainers of that are in Finland. And they work quite closely together. Well, at least they did last time I looked at them, which is a few years ago now.

[00:47:33] SPEAKER_01: But, and otherwise you're at the mercy of Carawong.

[00:47:37] SPEAKER_01: Or Carawong, do they implement, they use SCOSMOS? No, no, no. They've got, they use PRESS. PRESS. Yeah, VOCPRESS and PRESS.

[00:47:48] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I mean, they're different. They're nearer and, but, you know, you've got to wrangle Nick and his delivery priorities and such like. But is PRESS an open source? That's something that Carawong have adopted. All of their software that is sitting in GitHub, so you can, so it's open source, but Carawong developed it. I mean, Nick developed PRESS. They developed PRESS. Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's, that's their, you know, it was, I don't know if it anymore, was their, was their core product. Now you can just pick it up and deploy it, but, you know, you're more likely to want to contract them to do it for you.

[00:48:36] SPEAKER_00: Yep. Yep.

[00:48:38] SPEAKER_01: And then you need to make, then you need to make sure the contract's written well.

[00:48:45] SPEAKER_01: So, because Nick's got a bit of a reputation about not, not finishing his deliveries.

[00:48:52] SPEAKER_01: No, that, that's good. Yep. That's really good to know. Very insightful. Thank you. I know we're on time. So. You know. Pragmatic. I, I'm a big fan of Nick's work, don't get me wrong.

[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: But, but, but, but, as a contractor, I know from many people's reports.
